# security-qa-roadmap

Hands-on roadmap to transition from **Senior QA Automation** to **Security QA / Application Security**
by building practical, repeatable security tests.

Each checkpoint includes:
**goal → target endpoint → negative test → evidence → result**

## Structure
- `phase-1-api-security/` → OWASP API Top 10 focused tests (Postman-first)

## Phases
- **Phase 1:** API & App Security fundamentals (IDOR, Auth, Rate Limiting, Business Logic)
- **Phase 2:** Security automation & DevSecOps (Newman, CI)
- **Phase 3:** Offensive awareness (safe labs)
- **Phase 4:** Platform & Cloud basics
- **Phase 5:** Certifications & portfolio hardening
- **Phase 6:** Job-ready package

> Consistency beats intensity.
